# Zombie-Shooter

Zombie Shooter is a primitive game written for a University Course, but don't let that fool you. 

This simple yet fun game written in Java allows you to shoot and kill zombies with ease. 
With its basic graphics, the game is easy to pick up and play, while its use of multithreading allows for smoother gameplay and better performance, even with multiple enemies on screen at once.
Moreover, Zombie Shooter's Java Swing-based interface makes it easy to navigate through the game. 

Although it may not have the advanced graphics and features of more complex games, Zombie Shooter is still a fun and entertaining way to spend your free time.
